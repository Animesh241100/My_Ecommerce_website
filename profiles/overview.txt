Overview of profiles app:


In urls.py ->
Add:  from profiles import views as user_views

in urlpatterns:

path('profile/', user_views.profile, name='profile'),

I am attaching "views.py" which gives a chance for user to check his details

profile.html -> to display (render it as per the frontend guy designs)
